In practice, C++ simply suplies the mechanisms for defining new data structures.
 
				1.Bilt-in object types. (exists)
				2.Operation operators.  (becomes)
				3.Statements of flow.	 (does)
			 	
Most programming languages depend on the type of an object to limit its possible operations.

In the case of statements, which are executed sequentially one statement after the other, only certain types of objects complement certain statements of control.
 
Once joined, a matching statement together with an object type will result in an expression.

Classes can be implemented to define new object types, resulting in a class type.

C++ allows classes to make use of types that include operations as well as data.




Statements:				Types:				Operators

	if				int				++
	else				float				<
	for				char				==
	while				bool				=
	switch				void
	throw				vector
	try				double
	break				string
	do while
	continue
	goto
	
	

Expressions:
	
	if(a<b)
	while(true)
	for(int a; a<=10; ++a)
	else
