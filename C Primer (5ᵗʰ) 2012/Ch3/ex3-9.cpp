Q:
What does the following program do? Is it valid?If not, why not?
string s;
cout << s[0] << endl;


A:
Yes, it is a valid program that prints the first char of empty 'string s' however, since 's' is empty, 
only an empty line is printed to stdout as oposed to a reference to a memory address or any other unrecognised character.
