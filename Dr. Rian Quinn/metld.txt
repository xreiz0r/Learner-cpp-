-Meltdown and Spectre atake-

relies on 'speculative execution' from the kernel/CPU

STAGE 1
A speculative.exe is forced, causing a gap between loading the info into the cache, and if the info requested has any security restriction.

STAGE 2
If the CPU is interrupted during this gap (transient instruction)
the info gets left loaded into the cache with no restriction.

STAGE 3
To recover the info from cache withouth triggering any direct memory operation, side-channel atakes are used

TASK:COMPLETE
recover sensitive information stored in the kernel, using
nothing more than an unprivileged application!
